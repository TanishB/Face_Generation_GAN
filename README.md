# Face_Generation_GAN

A generator network to generate *new* images of faces that look as realistic as possible! using DCGAN.

## Get Data
[CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA)](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) is used to train the adversarial network. This dataset is more complex than the number datasets (like MNIST or SVHN) so it is suggested that you utilize a GPU for training.<br>
